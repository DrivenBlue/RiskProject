Attention! This game is playable but it does not have a lot of the features of a real risk game. There are no boundaries so 
you can attack anywhere. There is no incentive to controlling more territories besides being closer to victory (no extra soldiers).
The resolution options also need a fix and music needs to be added.
Random dice generation is done through a bubble sort in an attempt to emulate actual risk games. The attacker will have one more
dice than the defender. More comments in the source code. 

This is a version of the board game risk. The UI features a Start, Help, and Options button upon opening the application. There 
are also two backgrounds that randomly display during the start menu.

Start: A world map will appear along with a bunch of buttons sprawled across the map. Each player (depending on how many players 
you set in options) will take turns placing their armies until all have been placed. It is then player one's turn and he/she can 
attack any opponent. There must be at least one soldier in each of your territories. After a set amount of rounds, the players will 
again be able to add a certain amount of soldiers. When there is none of your opponents left, the victory "Player X wins" screen 
will appear and the game will reset after a few seconds.

Options: The options allow for the player to set how many players they will play with. There are no AI opponents so this game is 
only PVP. There is also an option on "rounds before adding armies," and "How many soldiers to add per round." At the very bottom
is an option to change the resolution of the screen size, though it is not yet operable so I would not use it. 

Help: This page has a button that leads to the Risk wikipedia game.
